# Background:
Our proposal is to design a web application that provides automatic course scheduling
service for Computer Science students in Case Western Reserve University. The current
alternative is the SIS system, which has significant drawbacks:
1) The system is not designed specifically to serve our target audiences.
2) The system does not provide automatic scheduling based on the student’s current status and
make course recommendations.
3) The graduation requirements for Computer Science Department are more complicated
compared to most of other majors since five different tracks could be selected and multiple listed
courses are no longer provided.

# Requirements:
 User registration: Create new users, user information collection (courses taken, year of
study)
 Automatic Scheduling: Based on entered preferences including the number of C.S. course
credits intended to take, time slots unavailable, and other non-C.S. courses intended totake, the web application generates recommended schedules that consider course
prerequisites, availability, and difficulty level.
